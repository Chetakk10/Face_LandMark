🛠 How It Works
The system leverages MediaPipe's Face Mesh solution to detect faces and predict 468 high-fidelity facial landmarks per face in real time. It converts each video frame to RGB, processes it to find face meshes, and optionally draws the landmarks using OpenCV.

🎯 What It's Useful For
🕹️ Augmented Reality (AR) — anchor filters, masks, or 3D effects to facial features.

😀 Facial Expression Analysis — detect smiles, eyebrow raises, or eye blinks.

🧑‍🏫 Gesture-Based Interfaces — build hands-free controls using facial movement.

🎭 Emotion Recognition Preprocessing — feed landmarks into emotion classifiers.

🧪 Research & Education — study facial movement and landmark-based tracking.
